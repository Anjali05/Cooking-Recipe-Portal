                Before we talk about us, let’s talk about you.

You love to eat. That’s right, we’ve got your number. There’s no need to be shy about it — we love to eat, too.  

We’ve been helping you eat for awhile now, and we wouldn’t have it any other way. We also know about all the other stuff you love: Like cooking and getting together, and talking about eating, and sharing it all here, on Recipe.com.
 
Over the fifteen-year life span of Recipe.com, we’ve learned that – in addition to eating – sharing is what you do best. And thanks to the 20 million of you who come here each month, we now have 500,000 recipes to show for it, more than anywhere else in the digital universe. We also have tons crazy-tempting photos, troves of recipe reviews and more than 2 million Facebook likes. That’s a heck of a lot of Food. Thank you!
 
We thought we’d celebrate with a fresh, new Recipe. Our aim is to make all this cooking, eating and sharing easier. Whether it’s finding a recipe, showing off your latest cooking triumph, photographing a killer meal or sharing the shortcuts that make your life run more smoothly, the new-and-improved Food.com makes this place – your home for sharing all things food – the spot to be.
